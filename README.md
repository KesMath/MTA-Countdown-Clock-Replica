Repository that pulls in real time data feeds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority based in New York City. The goal is to analyze weekday 2 & 5 North Bound Lines and discover trends based on emergency alerts. By uncovering emergency trends, the findings can be published so that commuters can know: the probability of the type of emergency happening, which stop it typically occurs on the transit line, and finally, which day and what time during the day it occurs. Commuters can avoid getting caught in major delay points by using this predictive model to find alternate travel means.
