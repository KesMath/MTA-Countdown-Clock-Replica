Repository that pulls in real time data feeds from the Metropolitan Transportation Authority based in New York City.
The goal of this repo serves as a _'Hello World'_ into the realm of electronics to which I shall replicate a real-time
countdown clock normally found in MTA subway stations. This shall be accomplished by mapping the std_out stream of this
application along with relevant static content (i.e. portable pixel format image and train text) to display on LED matrix controlled by a Raspberry Pi.
